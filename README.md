# Lichess studies in PDF

The goal of this project is to create a software that convert all my Lichess study in PDF format. Lichess is a Chess platform that allows you to create study plan of your Chess games. I use it to collect all my studies about openings, end games, tacticts, and so on.
Once this studies are ready I will convert them in PDF using this project.

### Tactics

Chess tactics are discussed often, but what is a chess tactic? There are many ways to describe chess tactics, but perhaps the simplest is to say that a chess tactic is a move (or series of moves) that brings an advantage to a player. This advantage can be material, like winning a piece, or even an attack that results in checkmate! Richard Teichmann's famous quote that "Chess is 99% tactics" may not be exactly true, but this sentiment shows the importance of chess tactics.
