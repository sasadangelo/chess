{ Queen vs King End Game is the simplest end game to play. Unless White doesn't blunder he should win the game. In order to do that, he must follow five important rules:
1. Push the opponent's king towards one of the four board edges.
2. Push the opponent's king towards one of the two edge corners.
3. Avoid the stalemate with the Queen.
4. Put the King in c3, c6, f3, or f6 depending on the corner where is the opponent's King.
5. Give checkmate with the Queen.

In order to learn how to apply these five rules, let's see them in reverse order. }

{ If you applied perfectly the first 4 rules in the Introduction you're in a position like this. Black King is in one of the four board edges in one of the two corners. White King is three squares away from the corner in c3, c6, f3, or f6. In this example, he is in f6. White Queen must be one rank away from the board edge to force the King on the edge and, at the same time, she must be four square away from the other corner edge to avoid the stalemate. In this configuration give a checkmate is really easy. Play Qg7#. } { [%cal Gf6h8,Ge7h7,Ge7e8] }
1. Qg7# { Congratulations! Checkmate. If King was in h8 it was checkmate too, using the same move. Now the question is: starting from whatever position how we can achieve the start position of this chapter? Let's see it in the next chapter. } *

{ Black King is blocked on the 8th rank. In order to give checkmate, White need to push it toward the h8 corner. In this position, Black King is force to move in g8. }
6... Kg8 { Queen push the Black King in the corner with the move Qe7. } 7. Qe7 { Black King now is force to move Kh8. } 7... Kh8 { It's important here to avoid absolutely the move Qf7 because it is a stalemate. The Queen must be 4 squares away from the other edge of the corner. From this moment White must move White King to one of its 4 positions: c3, c6 f3, or f6. In our example, White must move King toward the f6 square. } { [%cal Gf3f6,Ge7h7] } 8. Kf4 { Move White King in f4. } { [%cal Gf4f6,Ge7h7] } 8... Kg8 { Black King can only go back and forth in g8 or h8. Let's move it in g8. } { [%cal Gf4f6,Ge7h7] } 9.

White is ready to give checkmate to the next move. } { [%cal Gf6f8,Gf6h6,Ge7h7] } 10... Kg8 { We achieved the position studied in the chapter "Checkmate with the Queen". It's time to give checkmate with Qg7#. } 11. Qg7# { Congratulations! Checkmate. This is all the theory you need to know to win a Queen vs King End Game. If you're Black the only possibilities you have is to move the Black King toward a corner and hope for a stalemate. This sometime is possible when you play with low rated players but if you play with an experienced chess player it's better to resign as soon as he Queen vs King configuration appear on the chessboard. } *
