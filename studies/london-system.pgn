{ The London Opening is a Queen’s pawn opening (see Opening Basics and Principles study) that utilizes mainly the same moves regardless of the opponent’s response limiting possible lines which suit a beginner player with less to remember but also has strong central control which suits advanced players with a solid pawn chain set-up.

The first-ever game recorded in a London Encyclopedia of Chess Openings code (A46, A48 or D02) is Mason-Blackburne in London, 1883 although the London System took until 1922 to become popularised at the London BCF Congress Tournament of 1922.

The London system has a negative reputation because it is thought to be played the same way every time by chess players, and to an extent, that’s not incorrect, but by the same token it is not boring – Far from it. The London is a very playable position.

Because it is played in a similar fashion, London system players are often called lazy but played the right way with the right level of aggression your opponents may have to think again about your solid position, and more about their defense against it than how they feel about you playing it against them

So to keep your black pieces opponents off your back for a ‘Boring and Lazy Opening’ let’s take a look at how we can attack and keep them on the back foot, and how to respond to the various ways they may try to play against you after the first couple of moves. }

2... c5 { White supports the d4 Pawn moving e3 a creating the right side of the pyramid. } { [%cal Ge2e3] } 3. e3 { White Pawn in d4 is supported by the e3 Pawn and the Knight in f3.

The best way to do that is Ne5 because the Knight will be defended by the Pawn in d4. Play Ne5. } { [%cal Gf7d5,Ga7c5] } 8. Ne5 { The advance of the Black Pawn in e6 is avoided. The White Knight in e5 is supported by the d4 Pawn and Bishop in g3.

{ The difference between the London System and the Accelerated London System is that the white bishop is developed to the f4 square on move 2 after black plays Nf6 before white develops their Knight to f6. It provides stronger control in the center for a solid position to attack kingside. The goal of this variation is to accelerate the creation of the Pawn pyramid that is the essence of this opening. }
2. Bf4 { White plays Bf4 immediately. } 2... Nf6 { Black replies with Nf6. White is ready to create the pyramid with e3 and c3. } { [%cal Ge2e3,Gc2c3] } 3. e3 { White start to build the right side of the pyramid with e3. } { [%cal Gf2d4] } 3... c5 { Black replies with c5 to attack the top of the pyramid. } { [%cal Gf2d4] } 4. c3 { White completes the pyramid with c3. } { [%cal Gf2d4,Gb2d4] } 4...

Nf3 { White plays Nf3. } 5... e6 { Black moves e6 connecting the two Pawn islands like the London System. From this moment on, White and Black have to develop their minor pieces like the London System (see green arrows). The moves are identical to the London System, for this reason, I will avoid to repeat them. } { [%cal Gf7d5,Gf1d3,Gb1d2,Gf4g3,Gf8d6,Gb7b6,Gc8b7] } *
