{ Hello! In this study, you will be learning the Caro-Kann Defense. The Caro-Kann defense was created in the 1800s by--well, Misters Caro and Kann, and is a great opening against 1. e4, the most common opening. This opening is very solid and it is not attacked easily. You should try this out in one of your games.

I hope you like this defense and that you win many games with the Caro-Kann. }
1. e4 { This defense is specially designed to fight against 1. e4, as long as the white player starts with 1. e4, you can play the Caro-Kann Defence.
Well, to play the Caro-Kann Defence, after 1. e4 you have to make the move 1... c6 } 1... c6 { The Caro-Kann Defense is considered one of the strongest openings available to Black and has been employed by many of the world chess champions, with Anatoly Karpov probably playing better with this defence.
The basic idea is to dominate the center controlling the d5 square that will be your next move. } { [%cal Gd2d4,Gc6d5] } 2. d4 { The common reply for White is d4. Then d5 will normally be your second move. (You can do it now) you also ask the rival if he wants to eat or maintain the tension } 2... d5 { The White player has many moves, the 4 that I indicate with the arrows being the most logical and common.
1. Nc3, the Main Line;
2. Nd2, the Modern Variation;
3. e5, the Advance Variation;
4. exd5, the Exchange Variation.
We will study each of these options in detail in the following chapters! } { [%cal Ge4e5,Gb1d2,Gb1c3,Re4d5] } *

{ In this position, the best move for Black is Bf5. This is the Classic Variation. } { [%cal Gc8f5] }
