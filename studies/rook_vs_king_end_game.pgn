{ Rook vs King End Game is a bit harder than the Two Rooks vs King and Queen vs King End Games, however, if you understand how to play it, it is very easy. Unless White doesn't blunder White (or Black if Rook and King are Black) should win the game. In order to do that, he must follow seven important rules:
1. King must be always close to the Rook to protect it.
2. Push the opponent's king towards one of the four board edges.
3. Push the opponent's king towards one of the two edge corners.
4. Put the King in g3-f2, c2-b3, b6-c6, or g6-f7 depending on the corner where is the opponent's King.
5. Checkmate with a Rook.
6. If you can't give Checkmate with the Rook gain a tempo with the Rook.
7. Avoid the Stalemate.

In order to learn how to apply these seven rules, let's start from the final position. }

{ Let's start the study with a possible final position. The Black King is in the 8th rank near the h8 corner. White Rook is in the 7th rank and White King in the 6th rank blocking the opponent's King. Black King can only move in h8. }

{ Let's suppose we are again in Example 1 position but now it's White turn. To give checkmate White must gain a tempo over the Black. What does it mean? Simply White do a neutral move that doesn't alter the position on the chessboard but allow to the White to gain a tempo over Black. Play Rf6. }
1. Rf6 { Black is forced to move Kh8. } 1... Kh8 { White is ready to give checkmate with Rf8#. Play Rf8#. } 2. Rf8# { Congratulations! Checkmate. A similar thing can be done with Example 2 with White turn to move. } *

{ Let's start from this position and let's see how to push the opponent's King towards one of the edge. It's important to remember that White King and Rook must always be very close to each other. Suppose we want to push the Black King towards the 8th rank. Play Re2. }
