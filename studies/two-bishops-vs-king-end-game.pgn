{ Two Bishops vs King End Game is not a very frequent end game and it is hard to play if you don't know how to approach it. Unless White doesn't blunder, White (or Black if the Two Bishops and King are Black) should win the game. In order to do that, he must follow six important rules:
1. King must be always be close to the Two Bishops to protect them.
2. Push the opponent's king towards one of the four board edges.
3. Push the opponent's king towards one of the two edge's corners.
4. Put the King in b3, g3, b6, or g6 depending on the corner where you want to push the opponent's King.
5. Checkmate with the Two Bishops.
6. Avoid the Stalemate gaining a tempo.

In order to learn how to apply these six rules, let's start from the final position. }

{ The question you should answer now it: To what angle should I push the Black King? The short answer is: if White King is on the left push it on the left, if White King is on the right push it on the right. The long answer, however, is that is true only if the White King is two squares away from the edge or less. For example, in this position you can push the Black King on the left. To do this, you must move the Two Bishops on the 7th rank. Let's see how. Black moves Kd8. } { [%cal Gc6a6] }
