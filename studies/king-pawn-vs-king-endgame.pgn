{ This study is devoted to King + Pawn vs. King endings. Most
players handle these endings with confidence, but some have trouble in less common positions. Very often the problem lies in the overuse of the theory of the opposition. While opposition is a very useful concept and its best field of application is Pawn endings, its value is sometimes overestimated.
King + Pawn vs. King endings are best explained by means of the key squares
theory, using opposition at the right time and adapting its value to each situation. I assume the reader knows the basic mates and the Bishop + Wrong Rook's Pawn ending. In any case, a perfect demonstration of these endings can be found in many books.

The following study will show:

* The Rule of the Square;
* Trade or not Trade?
* Block the way and support the Pawn with the King;
* Opposition;
* Distant Opposition;
* Distant Diagonal Opposition;
* Opposition: Pawn on the 6th rank (Win);
* Opposition: Pawn on the 6th rank (Draw);
* Opposition: Pawn on the 6th rank (Knight's Pawn);
* Opposition: Pawn on the 6th rank (Bishop's Pawn);
* Opposition: Pawn on the 5th rank (Win);
* Opposition: Pawn on the 5th rank (Knight's Pawn);
* Opposition: Pawn on the 4th rank;
* Opposition: the Rook's Pawn;
* Imprisoning the stronger's side King; }

{ The first question we have to answer in King + Pawn vs. King endings is this: Can the pawn promote without the aid of the King? Calculating the race between the Pawn and the enemy King is enough to answer this question. This calculation is not complicated but, anyway, experience has taught us a simple way to solve the problem at a glance: the so-called 'rule of the square'. This rule helps us calculate and can be applied to any other endgame which presents the same race situation. Play a4. }
1. a4 { After the Pawn advances, we draw an imaginary square that reaches the 8th rank. In this example, the vertices of the square are a4-a8-e8-e4. Black King plays Kf7. } { [%cal Ga4a8,Ga8e8,Ge8e4,Ge4a4,Ga4e8] } 1... Kf7 { Of course, the black King tries to prevent promotion. Now we are ready to state the main rule.
"Rule of the square: If the King can reach the square of the Pawn, then he can capture the pawn; if not, the Pawn promotes."
If. when recalling the rule, we doubt whether the king must reach the square with his move or he must already be inside, we shall observe this: if the King chased the Pawn from the rear (in this example it might be from b3) , should he be inside the square before moving? Of course not: therefore, it would be the same if the King came from farther away, be it from the pawn's rear or from its side.
White continue with a5. } { [%cal Ga4a8,Ga8e8,Ge8e4,Ge4a4,Ga4e8] } 2. a5 { It is clear that, in this case, the enemy King has not reached the square of the pawn, so White promotes to Queen. } { [%cal Ga5a8,Ga8d8,Gd8d5,Gd5a5,Ga5d8] } 2...

{ The Black King has clearly reached the square. Now the pawn can promote only with the aid of the King. The easiest way is by blocking the enemy King's way. This concept of blocking appears very often in Pawn endings, but also in many others, and it is at the core of Rook vs. Pawn endings.

We can now state the second rule, which works with almost all Pawns, the exception being the Rook's Pawn.

"When possible, the stronger side's King will prevent its rival from standing in front of the pawn. If he succeeds, the Pawn promotes."

{ We have just seen what happens in the two simplest cases:

1) When the King does not support the pawn.
2) When the King supports the pawn by preventing the enemy King from standing in its way.

However, the most interesting situation in a King + Pawn vs. King ending occurs when the defending king occupies a key square in front of the Pawn. Then, everything depends on the relative position of the Kings.

The first important position, which we must fix in our minds, occurs when the Pawn has reached the 6th rank and is only two steps away from the promotion square. Despite the proximity of the 8th rank, we will need to examine some positions before we grasp all the important details. In this position, the pawn can take its two last steps almost automatically.

{ However, the result changes completely if in this position it is Black's turn. The reason is that the pawn cannot promote if both kings are opposed when the pawn reaches the 7th rank. Then we say that they are in opposition. }
3... Kg8 { Now the kings are opposed and in this situation, almost always, the side that has the opposition has the advantage, and the side to move is at a disadvantage. As stated above, opposition has gained an excessive prestige; in some cases it is not so useful. If we want to make the most of it, and not to let it deceive us, we just have to notice how it suits us in each case.
"In a King + Pawn vs. King ending, king opposition is decisive when the Pawn is on the 6th rank."
This is the first important pattern we must recognise. Play f7+. } 4. f7+ { Here, the Pawn moves ahead but cannot promote. Black play Kf8. } 4... Kf8 { White is forced to move in Kf6 to avoid the Pawn capture and this lead to a stalemate.
In this ending we have seen that, if the defending King takes the opposition when the Pawn is on the 6th rank, the Pawn cannot promote. If we go deeper, we also see that the major obstacle for the white King has been his own Pawn.
Therefore, we can conclude that:
1) The stronger side must not push the pawn too quickly.
2) The Pawn should only reach the 6th rank in one of these two scenarios:
a) its path to promotion is clear, or
b) its advance causes the kings to be opposed (but usually this only happens when the King has reached the 6th rank before the Pawn) } 5. Kf6 { The game is a draw for stalemate. } *

{ Not all Pawns work the same. As we get closer to the edge of the board, pawns usually have their own rules. Therefore, I will devote a special section to the Rook's Pawn. The Knight's Pawn is not so exceptional, but nevertheless it presents some peculiarities due to the proximity of the edge of the board.

Let us have a look at the position: It is White's turn and he cannot take the opposition, while we know that if the king moves in front of the pawn he will have to retreat from his blocking position on his next move. This position would be lost if Black had a central pawn, but with a knight's pawn White can be saved thanks to a special detail. }
5. Kh1 { The right move is Kh1. This relative position of the Kings, called Diagonal Opposition, usually does not help much, but works in this case. } 5...

moves either, since the White King comes back to his impregnable position in front of the Pawn } *
