{ Chess is a game of war, invented over 1300 years ago in the country of India under the name Chaturanga. Over the years, it changed names; the rules changed, and eventually became the chess we know today.

Chess is a battle of the minds. Two people face off against each other on a checkered 64-square board, each controlling their own 16 piece army — one White, one Black — their armies consisting of 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2
Bishops, 2 Knights, and 8 Pawns. }

{ The goal of chess is to “checkmate” your opponent’s King. Checkmate occurs when the “checked” king is unable to escape “check” from the opposing army.

When the King is in check, he MUST get out of check! The King can NEVER move to a square where he is attacked. Checkmate is check PLUS the King is trapped: it can’t move, block, or capture the attacking piece. If you are in check, your only options are ABC (Avoid [move], Block, or Capture) }

{ The board has 64 squares, called “light” and “dark” squares. The horizontal rows are called “ranks,” and are numbered 1 through 8. The vertical columns are called “files,” and are given letters a through h. Each squares has a name, based on the rank and file to which the square belongs. For example, “e4”. White sets up on the first and second ranks, black on the seventh and eighth. Make sure both sides have a white square in the right-hand corner! }

{ Only the Knight can jump. Notice that the Knight always jumps from a light square to a dark square or vice versa. Bishops spend the whole game on the same color square. Initial placement on the board:

- Queen on her own color, or queens on the d-file, like “diamonds.”
- Kings and queens across from each other.
- Bishops are close advisers to the King and Queen explain kingside vs. queenside.

Each piece has a value in pawns. This number is indicative and doesn't have any role to win or lose a game. It is only useful to understand who has an advantage in terms of materials. Here the values:

- Queen = 9 pawns
- Rook = 5 pawns
- Bishop = 3 pawns
- Knight = 3 pawns
- Pawn = 1 pawn

If you sum the value of pieces captured by both the players you know who is in advantage. Mention that the king is PRICELESS because he can never be removed from the board! (In the endgame, the king is often said to have 3 or 4 points in fighting value).

Why are Bishops and Knights roughly equal in value? The Bishop can move from one side of the board to the other quickly, but the Knight can jump over pieces and visit all 64 squares.

“Bishops are like dogs, Knights are like cats.” — GM Dmitry Gurevich.

Important idea: pieces can become more or less valuable depending on their position. }

{ Castling involves the King and a Rook, and it is the only move in chess where two pieces can move at once. The King moves two squares to either the right or left of his starting square and the rook jumps over the king so they are next to each other. Castling is important because it enables the king to go to a safer place while bringing a rook to a more active place on the chessboard. Let's see an example, play O-O. }
1. O-O { Castling completed. The same is on the queenside. A Castling is possible if:
- King and the Rook must not have moved from their starting squares beforehand (the other rook could have moved).
- King cannot castle out of check.
- King cannot pass through check or land in check when castling occurs.
- The path must be completely clear between the King and the Rook concerned (if any piece is in the way, castling cannot happen). } *
